# About

Digital transformation is a new paradigm in the world of business. It is a new way of thinking about business, and it is a new way of doing business. I am a qualified chartered accountant that believe that technology will transform our industry completely. Using R and Shiny, I have created various web applications for local government to enable data analysis, long-term financial planning, and performance measurement the digital way. Managing diverse teams (often remote) delivering digital solution to multiple clients using latest technologies and platforms to meet the needs of clients. I am the bridge between the client and the ultimate solution.

# Professional Experience

## Cloud based data product development

Developed the first of it's kind cloud based data product for the local government. The product is a web application that allows users to view, analyze data using statistical models as well creating long-term financial plans using business logic, accounting principles and predictive models (ML & AI). The product is built using R and Shiny.

## Effective and Accountable in Project Delivery

Overcome complex business challenges and make high-stakes decisions using experience-backed judgement, strong work ethic and integrity. Lead a dynamic team of high performing cross-functional experts across delivery and technology as lever to solve burning issues and to educate organisation in best practices. I am incorporating **SCRUM** and the **Agile Development Methodology** to deliver on multiple projects with a diverse team of business analysts and developers. In our daily stand-up I am able to identify project delivery risks early and work with the team to find a solution before it affects the overall **project timeline** or deliverable **quality**.

Implementation of key metrics as part of the overall project delivery management enables me to have a view on the status of each project. At times I can manage up to 8 projects running concurrently with multiple clients and multiple technologies. Some of the technologies include .Net, Angular, React, C#, R, Python, Azure, PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, and SASS.

## Strategy & Business Development Specialist

Characterized as delivering extraordinary results in growth, revenue, operational performance and profitability. Delivering projects with gross profit in line with forecasts and management of project risks that can result in potential overruns early. I aim to identify and avoid taking on projects that has a high risk of financial loss whether it is due to budget constraints of technical constraints.

I successfully sold solutions to clients that use a recurring revenue model by making use of using licence fees and annual maintenance and support models. Selling add-ons to initial developed solutions has been critical in my career. Making that first sale to a client is hard work but once they see the value to the solutions we implement the next wave follows.

Supporting proposal and tender process with providing the technical response to client requirements. All problems are solvable using the right team that can implement appropriate technology. Fit for purpose in all instances.

## Deliver mission-critical results

Driven by the need to be innovative and to build strategies and tactics to make the words “It can’t be done!” obsolete. Using GitHub has been a critical part of project delivery success with continuous integration and continuous deployment (**CI/CD**) providing complete visibility to all stakeholders involved and continuous feedback to development teams. Getting from zero to one as quick as possible to show minimal viable product and then expand functionality from there is the path to successful project delivery.

## Strong orientations in operations and finance

Participate in high-level operational initiatives, including infrastructure design, process re-engineering, turnaround management and reorganization. Financial metrics are a key success factor in delivering successful projects and having a strong financial background assists me in understanding the financial impact of risks and changes in timelines.

## Respect and leverage human capital

Motivate, mentor and lead talented staff. Live the culture and lead by example. Direct teams using interactive and motivational leadership that spurs people to willingly give 110% effort and loyalty. Putting the right team together is a key success factor, prioritizing and making changes early in the projects leads to delivering a successful projects on time.
